# Tutorial01 - Hello Triangle

This tutorial demonstrates the basics of Diligent Engine API. It shows how to create shaders, pipeline state object
and how to render a simple triangle.

## Shaders

This tutotial uses very basic shaders. The vertex shader generates a procedural triangle. It uses an array of hard-coded
vertex positions in screen space and assigns red, green and blue colors to the vertices. The shader uses system-generated
vertex id as an array index.

```hlsl
struct PSInput 
{ 
    float4 Pos   : SV_POSITION; 
    float3 Color : COLOR; 
};

void main(in  uint    VertId : SV_VertexID,
          out PSInput PSIn) 
{
    float4 Pos[3];
    Pos[0] = float4(-0.5, -0.5, 0.0, 1.0);
    Pos[1] = float4( 0.0, +0.5, 0.0, 1.0);
    Pos[2] = float4(+0.5, -0.5, 0.0, 1.0);

    float3 Col[3];
    Col[0] = float3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0); // red
    Col[1] = float3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0); // green
    Col[2] = float3(0.0, 0.0, 1.0); // blue

    PSIn.Pos   = Pos[VertId];
    PSIn.Color = Col[VertId];
}
```
The shader is written in HLSL. Diligent Engine uses shader source code converter to translate HLSL
into GLSL when needed. It can also use shaders authored in GLSL, but there is no GLSL to HLSL converter.

Pixel (fragment) shader simply interpolates vertex colors and is also written in HLSL:

```hlsl
struct PSInput 
{ 
    float4 Pos   : SV_POSITION; 
    float3 Color : COLOR; 
};

struct PSOutput
{ 
    float4 Color : SV_TARGET; 
};

void main(in  PSInput  PSIn,
          out PSOutput PSOut)
{
    PSOut.Color = float4(PSIn.Color.rgb, 1.0);
}
```

## Initializing the Pipeline State

Pipeline state is the object that encompasses the configuration of all GPU stages. To create a pipeline state,
populate `PipelineStateDesc` structure:

```cpp
PipelineStateDesc PSODesc;
```

Start by giving the PSO a name. It is always a good idea to give all objects descriptive names as
Diligent Engine uses these names in error reporting:

```cpp
PSODesc.Name = "Simple triangle PSO"; 
```

There are two types of pipeline states: graphics and compute. This one is a graphics one:

```cpp
PSODesc.IsComputePipeline = false; 
```

Next, we need to describe which outputs the pipeline state uses. This one has one output, the screen,
whose format can be queried through the swap chain object:

```cpp
PSODesc.GraphicsPipeline.NumRenderTargets = 1;
PSODesc.GraphicsPipeline.RTVFormats[0]    = pSwapChain->GetDesc().ColorBufferFormat;
PSODesc.GraphicsPipeline.DSVFormat        = pSwapChain->GetDesc().DepthBufferFormat;
```

Next, we need to define what kind of primitives the pipeline can render, which are triangles in our case:

```cpp
PSODesc.GraphicsPipeline.PrimitiveTopology = PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST;
```

In this example, we do not want to worry about culling back-facing triangles, so we disable it:

```cpp
PSODesc.GraphicsPipeline.RasterizerDesc.CullMode = CULL_MODE_NONE;
```

This pipeline state does not use depth testing:

```cpp
PSODesc.GraphicsPipeline.DepthStencilDesc.DepthEnable = False;
```

The pipeline state also allows configuring several other states (rasterizer state, blend state, input layout etc.),
but default values will work for now.

On the next step, we need to create shader objects. To create a shader, populate `ShaderCreateInfo` structure.

```cpp
ShaderCreateInfo ShaderCI;
```

The shaders are authored in HLSL, so we need to tell the system:

```cpp
ShaderCI.SourceLanguage = SHADER_SOURCE_LANGUAGE_HLSL;
```

When running in OpenGL mode, Diligent converts HLSL to GLSL. Since there are no separate
texture samplers in GLSL, Diligent uses emulated combined samplers 
(g_Texture + g_Texture_sampler pair). Event though this pixel shader does not use textures,
we still need to indicate we are using combined texture samplers, otherwise conversion will fail:

```cpp
ShaderCI.UseCombinedTextureSamplers = true;
```

In this example, vertex and pixel shaders are created from the source. The code is self-explanatory:

```cpp
// Create a vertex shader
RefCntAutoPtr<IShader> pVS;
{
    ShaderCI.Desc.ShaderType = SHADER_TYPE_VERTEX;
    ShaderCI.EntryPoint      = "main";
    ShaderCI.Desc.Name       = "Triangle vertex shader";
    ShaderCI.Source          = VSSource;
    pDevice->CreateShader(ShaderCI, &pVS);
}

// Create a pixel shader
RefCntAutoPtr<IShader> pPS;
{
    ShaderCI.Desc.ShaderType = SHADER_TYPE_PIXEL;
    ShaderCI.EntryPoint      = "main";
    ShaderCI.Desc.Name       = "Triangle pixel shader";
    ShaderCI.Source          = PSSource;
    pDevice->CreateShader(ShaderCI, &pPS);
}
```

Finally, we set the shaders in the `PSODesc` and create the pipeline state:

```cpp
PSODesc.GraphicsPipeline.pVS = pVS;
PSODesc.GraphicsPipeline.pPS = pPS;
pDevice->CreatePipelineState(PSODesc, &m_pPSO);
```

The pipeline state keeps references to the shader objects, so the app does not need to keep the references
unless it wants to use them.

## Rendering

All rendering commands in Diligent Engine go through device contexts that are very 
similar to D3D11 device contexts. There is immediate context that directly 
executes commands and deferred contexts. Deferred contexts are intended to record command 
lists that can later be executed by the immediate context.

Before rendering anything on the screen we want to clear it:

```cpp
const float ClearColor[] = {  0.350f,  0.350f,  0.350f, 1.0f }; 
m_pImmediateContext->ClearRenderTarget(nullptr, ClearColor, RESOURCE_STATE_TRANSITION_MODE_TRANSITION);
m_pImmediateContext->ClearDepthStencil(nullptr, CLEAR_DEPTH_FLAG, 1.f, 0,
                                       RESOURCE_STATE_TRANSITION_MODE_TRANSITION);
```

Passing `nullptr` makes the engine clear default (i.e. the swap chain's) render 
and depth buffers. Clearing the depth buffer is not really necessary, but we will 
keep it here for consistency. Using `RESOURCE_STATE_TRANSITION_MODE_TRANSITION` flag tells the
engine to perform required state transitions.

Next, we need to set our pipeline state in the immediate device context:

```cpp
m_pImmediateContext->SetPipelineState(m_pPSO);
```

Next step is very important: we need to commit all shader resources:

```cpp
m_pImmediateContext->CommitShaderResources(nullptr, RESOURCE_STATE_TRANSITION_MODE_TRANSITION);
```

The first argument of `CommitShaderResources()` is the shader resource binding object. We do not have
one in this tutorial. The `RESOURCE_STATE_TRANSITION_MODE_TRANSITION` tells the system that resources
need to be transitioned to correct states. Transitioning resources introduces some overhead and can be
avoided when it is known that resources are already in correct states.

Finally, we invoke the draw command that renders our 3 vertices:

```cpp
DrawAttribs drawAttrs;
drawAttrs.NumVertices = 3;
m_pImmediateContext->Draw(drawAttrs);
```

And that's it!
